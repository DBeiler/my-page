    <h1>Meet David Beiler</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my page! I'm David Beiler, and I'm excited to share my journey into the world of technology.</p>

        <h2>Why I'm Learning Computers</h2>
        <p>
            Technology is shaping the world around us, and I want to be part of that transformation. I'm learning about
            computers because I believe they are powerful tools for creativity, problem-solving, and building a better future.
            From understanding how software works to exploring how machines communicate, I'm diving deep into this fascinating world.

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Sharing Knowledge with Others</h2>
        <p>
            Learning is even more rewarding when it's shared. I want to help others who are starting their tech journey—
            whether it's answering questions, mentoring, or creating content that explains difficult topics in simple ways.
            Building a supportive tech community is something I'm passionate about.
        </p>

        <h2>Starting a Career in Tech</h2>
        <p>
            My goal is to launch a career in the tech industry where I can continue learning and contribute to meaningful projects.
            I'm especially interested in areas like web development, cybersecurity, and software engineering. With every step,
            I'm getting closer to turning my passion into a profession.
